# TicTacTau
Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Greek Alphabet made in Unity3D

This was a fun little project I threw together for a job interview. I went beyond the basic goal of creating a Tic-Tac-Toe game, adding:
- Player letter selection (Greek Alphabet)
- Human or AI players
- Different board sizes and rule sets
